# Hello!

I am a PhD student from the University of Neuchatel. I am studying the evolution of cooperation between non relatives [in wild vervet monkeys](https://inkawuvervetproject.weebly.com/).
My main research goal is to study the physiological aspects of social bonds and cooperative behaviour with major interest in genetic analysis.

I have very broad interests from many different areas of biology, statistics, computer science, and elsewhere. 
My current programming interests include:

 - bayesian statistics
 - machine learning
 - phyton programming
 - bioinformatics
 - genome-wide studies

Do not hesitate to contact me for future collaborations or projects!
