# Hi!

Iâ€™m an Ethologist graduated from [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/cmlink/stockholm-university). 
My major research goal is to understand the evolutionary forces shaping animal behaviour in the wild, 
specially cognitive traits through population genetics.

I have very broad interests from many different areas of biology, statistics, computer science, and elsewhere. 
My current programming interests include:

 - bayesian statistics;
 - machine learning;
 - phyton programming;
 - bioinformatics;
 - genome-wide studies.
